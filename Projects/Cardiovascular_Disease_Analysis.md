# CARDIOVASCULAR DESEASE ANALYSIS

This analysis was made as a final project for my Data Analytics certification by Simplilearn and Purdue University.

It was intended to to determine and examine the factors that play a significant role in increasing the rate of heart attacks. 
It was also required to use the findings to create and predict a model.
