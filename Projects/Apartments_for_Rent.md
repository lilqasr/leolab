This project consisted on building a dataset from a real state web page in Italy to analyse the rental apartments market in Rome.

The first part of the process was to scrape the website in order to get the follow information:

1.  Property location,
2.  Price,
3.  Size,
4.  Spaces,
5.  Bathrooms

The second part was the most challenging, The cleaning!

After all the process, i got a dataset with 1916 records.

In a second moment, i will have the project with visualizations by municipality, and maybe, by urbanistic zone.
